# Contributing to the djsaml2-idp-app package

First of all, thank you for contributing to the project! The more, the merrier.

I welcome all contributions; issues/bug reports, adding tests, adding or requesting functionality, improving documentation, suggesting implementation improvements ...

## About the project

This package started off on a need-to-have basis to use in the company I work for. I did not spend time to build an all-encompassing solution; so what we did not use or need was not implemented. Several features since then have been added by contributors with their own needs in mind. Therefore, if something is missing that you need, feel free to ask about it and I'm happy to take a look.

While I created this package due to a need in the company for something like this, I maintain it privately. I am not paid for it nor work on it during 'company time', it is a private side project. My response time will therefore be dependent on my available time and is a best-effort matter. Please keep this in mind and my apologies in advance if a response runs a bit late. We all have lives to lead :)

## Practicalities

Some notes for when you want to start adding code to the project.

### Tests

- Instructions are in the [README.rst](README.rst)). Please make sure the tests succeed, they will be run when you create a PR in the repo. Also try to provide some formal testing of new code you are adding. We have spent some time to make sure there is a high test coverage of the code, and I would love to keep it like that.

### Codestyle

- Formatting: I mostly like to follow the PEP8 standard, with some customized rules applied.
- For code quality and consistency checks, I recommend the [PyLama](https://github.com/klen/pylama) tool. You run it by executing
    ```bash
    pylama --options pytest.ini
    ```
    in the root of the project. It only outputs violations, so if you don't get any output, you did great. Please ensure pylama succeeds when creating a PR (it will be run automatically via CI).
- When you create a PR for functionality or bugfix, don't mix in unrelated formatting changes along with it.
